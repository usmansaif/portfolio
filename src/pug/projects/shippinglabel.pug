            p The Shipping Labels application was developed for internal use by a client specializing in exporting fresh dates from Saudi Arabia to international markets. Previously, the client relied on manual processes, including handwriting shipping information on each carton and maintaining records in physical registers. The new application automated these processes by generating shipping label stickers for cartons and PDFs for customer communication. It also ensured accurate record-keeping for backtracking purposes.
            p p The application was built using
